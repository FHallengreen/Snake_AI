# Snake AI Performance Analysis

## Latest Performance Results

### Updated Model Performance (Latest Evaluation)
- **Original model**: 
  - Average score: 46.80 ± 8.57
  - Median score: 46.50
  - Maximum score: 59.00
  - Minimum score: 30.00
  - Average steps: 1171.70

- **Enhanced model**:
  - Average score: 49.80 ± 14.16
  - Median score: 53.00
  - Maximum score: 72.00
  - Minimum score: 14.00
  - Average steps: 1350.70

### Comprehensive Performance Improvement Analysis

| Metric | Improvement | Analysis |
|--------|------------|----------|
| Average Score | 6.4% | Meaningful improvement in overall performance |
| Median Score | 13.9% | Substantial improvement in typical performance |
| Maximum Score | 22.0% | Dramatic increase in peak performance capability |
| Average Steps | 15.3% | Significantly longer survival time |
| Score Variability | Increased | Higher standard deviation (8.57 → 14.16) indicates both higher peaks and occasional lower scores |

## Performance Distribution Analysis

The enhanced model shows an interesting performance profile:
- Most games (8 out of 10) score between 41-72
- Median performance improved significantly (46.50 → 53.00)
- The enhanced model can achieve substantially higher peak scores (72 vs 59)
- Occasionally produces lower outlier scores (one game with score 14)

This suggests the continued training has optimized for higher scores while occasionally making riskier decisions that can lead to early termination.

### Strategic Implications

1. **Risk-Taking Behavior**: The enhanced model appears to employ more aggressive strategies with higher risk/reward tradeoffs
2. **Game Length Management**: Average steps increased from 1171.70 to 1350.70, indicating better long-term survival
3. **Breakthrough Performance**: The 72 score game represents a breakthrough performance level not seen in the original model

## Future Optimization Directions

Based on these results, potential areas for future optimization include:

1. **Risk Management**: Tuning to reduce the occurrence of low-scoring outlier games
2. **Consistency Refinement**: Using techniques to reduce performance variance while maintaining high peaks
3. **Specialized Strategies**: Training separate models for different game phases (early, mid, and late game)
